## 👋 What is Tech Africa?

**Tech Africa** is not just a blog. It is a unified ecosystem designed to connect, showcase, and empower the next generation of African developers, founders, and creators.

We realized that the African tech ecosystem was fragmented—news was in one place, jobs in another, and open source projects were hidden. **We built the solution.**

One Platform. One Community. Limitless Opportunity.
